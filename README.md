# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project was created to begin exposure to the world of web development. It has, so far, granted exposure to HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. The lessons learned throughout this project have allowed for a beginner's level of understanding into these languages and processes. 

The webpage created will stand as a basic reference, and as a study guide for future endeavors. It contains some of the basic concepts required to carry out web development that must be remembered or refreshed until they become second nature.

## Installation

Installation is not required. The webpage is accessible from any web browser application.

## Usage

This Prework Study Guide can be used by any beginner web developers as a reference guide for some of the beginner concepts of HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript. Although not an exhaustive guide, it does contain useful information.

Within the Prework Study Guide there are four sections including HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript. If DevTools in a web browser such as Google Chrome is opened we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose a topic for us to study first.
