        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The head element contains the meta information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The meta information tells the browser information on how to display the page.</li>
          <li>The meta information isn't displayed to the user.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The body element contains a header section, in which there is usually a "<'h1>"" tag.</li>
          <li>There are 6 levels of headers from h1 to h6.</li>
          <li>there should only be one h1 on any webpage.</li>
          <li>"Main" resides within the body and contains the main body of the webpage.</li>
          <li>"main" can be divided into section with the section tag.</li>
          <li>Secitons can be tagged with identifiers such as class and id, which are useful later for css and maybe javascript.</li>
          <li>Images can be inserted with ths syntax: img src="image source(url, or other i assume)" alt="word description" and this tag
            is ended simply by a slash at the end rather than using a typical end tag.</li>
          <li>Most elements have opener and closer tags, For example, <'h1> and <'/h1>.</li>
          <li>However, some elements like "img" close within the first set of chevrons by adding a '/' at the end of a single chevron set.
            i.e. '<'img src="./assets/bowtie-cat.png" alt="Profile image of cat wearing a bow tie." />
          </li>
          <li>links to other websites can be added by using the "a" tag with syntax '<'a href="url">"Your text here" '<'/a></li>
          <li>Some elements of HTML are semantic, meaning their tag names indicate their role. For example "header" "footer "body"</li>
          <li>Some elements are non-semantic. For example, "div" and "span"</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS can be used inline, with an internal style sheet, or with and external style sheet.</li>
          <li>Most development will be done with an external style sheet because of a concept called "Separation of Concerns."</li>
          <li>Separation of Concerns is separating code into different files based on use. This must make it easier to determine code function and modify in the future.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>header and footer commands can change the width(in percentage), the height in pixels, the backgroun color and text color
            ,etc.</li>
          <li>Text-align indicates where the text is to be placed, i.e. center.</li>
          <li>Background color dictates the background color of respective section.</li>
          <li>Display: block makes item a block like a paragraph, starting it on a new line.</li>
          <li>Images can be resized using pixels.</li>
          <li>Font-size can be used in pixels to adjust font size.</li>
          <li>CSS can be applied to each section as defined by class, and I assume by id. These variables are defined in each "section"
            within the HTML.</li>
          <li>Text-shadow adds a shadow to text.</li>
          <li></li>

        <ul>
          <li>Git status = checks which branch we are in</li>
          <li>Git checkout -b "branch name" = checkout move the working branch to a new branch, 
            -b flag creates a new branch,"branch name" is the name of the new branch, and switches to new branch</li>
          <li>Git add -A = add adds modifications in the current working branch to the staging area, 
            -A indicates that we want to add all changes, The staging area informs Git that the changes will be added in the next commit</li>
          <li>Git commit -m “add starter code” = commit creates a snapshot of the currently staged changes. 
            Once committed, our working branch will be updated with the starter code.</li>
          <li>Git pull origin main = pull commands to receive a branch’s modification into the local environment, 
            origin indicates the source as the GitHub repo, main indicates the branch, also switches to main branch</li>
          <li>Git push origin feature/starter code = push pushes changes from local to GitHub, origin indicates GitHub repo, 
            feature/starter code is data name</li>

          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>for loops can be used to process data in an array.</li>
          <li>functions are an important part of coding.</li>
          <li>Functions can be predefined or can be written by the coder.</li>
          <li>If a function is written, it must be called in order or it to run.</li>
          <li>Google chrome developer tools is a great way to test code.</li>
          <li>A function can be created with the function "name"().</li>
          <li>var is used to create a variable.</li>
          <li>var can also be used to define an array.</li>
          <li>An array is created by var "name" = [item,item,item, etc]</li>
          <li>for loops can be embedded within functions to be called later.</li>
          <li>console.log is used to print i.e. console.log(hello, world)</li>
